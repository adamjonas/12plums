      <dt>What is 12plums?</dt>
      <dd>12plums is a subscription box service that offers all-natural beauty and personal care products to expectant and new moms.  When we are pregnant we adjust our routines to stop drinking, smoking and eating certain foods because of the proven health hazards to our unborn children.  Nonetheless, very few women change their beauty routines to eliminate ingredients that are also potentially hazardous.  This is probably a combination of willful blindness and lack of education as to the wealth of safe and effective products on the market.  Our mission is to help mothers pamper themselves and their newborns safely and without the compromise many wrongfully associate with "natural beauty".  To that end, we are partnering with the best all-natural products which we will introduce to our subscribers in our boxes.  This will allow our subscribers to learn about and test products such as yours that they might not otherwise have known about.</dd>
      <dt>Who is 12plums for?</dt>
      <dd>12plums is all about moms.  If you are a “green mommy”, then 12plums is for you.  If you have never used organic or all-natural products and think they aren’t any good, the 12plums is for you.  If you fall somewhere in between, guess what, 12plums is for you too.  As long as you are pregnant, or a new mother, you fit our profile.  We bring you the best beauty and personal care products to pamper yourself and your newborn safely and beautifully.  All beauty should be safe and luxurious and that is what 12plums is all about.</dd>
      <dt>What are your standards for the products included in each 12plums box?</dt>
      <dd>We evaluate all of our brands thoroughly to make sure that they animal and eco-friendly, sustainable, free of harsh chemicals, synthetic dyes, artificial fragrances and colors, parabens, phthalates, sulfates, petroleum, mineral oils, retinoids, salicylic acids, BHAs, BHTs, soy (except for some of our candles), certain essential oils, and the list goes on and on.  Our goal is to provide expectant and new mothers with personal care products that are truly safe for mother and child.  When there is a difference of opinion on an ingredient, we err on the side of caution.  Many but not all of our brands are organic but even the organic ingredients are thoroughly vetted.  We test all of products and evaluate their ingredients no matter what.  Nonetheless, we recommend that you look over the ingredients for yourself and consult your physician if you have any questions.  You have the final say as to what you put on yourself and your child.  We just want to make it easier for you.  However, you may have allergies or other reactions that we cannot protect against.  Furthermore, 12plums does not make any guarantees as to the safety to you or your child as related to these products but we do our best to provide you with only the safest products on the market. </dd>
